# UFOS

## Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to use javascript and with the creation of html we can provide adequate information about UFO sightings throughout the country, so that we can filter the results by city, state, date, shape of the object, and description of the sighting. .
For this we use the following tools:
  - VsCode
  - Google Chrome
  - Java Script
  - Html.

  ## Overview

  In this project we are going to build a web page where we can provide information to people about UFO sightings, but we want to do it using Javascript to create an html that allows us to filter the information according to what the users are looking for. we had to organize our folders that are going to contain our files like our data, app.js, index.html and style.css

  ## Results

After having created our code and applying it to our html we were able to collect the information about UFO sightings.
We were also able to create a unique style for our page such as background color, font style and even add an image as shown below.

To organize our information we had to create a table where we can distribute the sightings by:
- City
- Estate
- Date
- Shape of the object
- Description.

We did this so that people who visit our site can filter the results according to their preferences.

We added several filters so that people can filter the information by applying one or more of them, in the following example we apply the "city" filter and by typing: "boca raton" we obtained the following result:

When we apply several filters we also obtain more concrete results, as long as these results are available; otherwise it will not give us any result like the example shown below:

## Summary

In conclusion, this project helps us prepare to better visualize the data we want to present and where customers or users can interact with the page and see relevant information that may interest them.

Thanks to the console tools and elements we can see our code in real time and how it is being applied to our page, in this way we can modify it to make it cleaner and more organized.
- A problem that I found is being able to give a style to our table, being able to customize it to make it more attractive.

### Recommendation
- As a recommendation we should have modified the code so that blankspaces can be applied and we can still see the results.
- Another recommendation is that even if we use upper or lower case letters, we can continue to see results, because if we do not write the specific data, it does not show us any information, so we should change the code so that it shows us precise and approximate results as recommendations.
